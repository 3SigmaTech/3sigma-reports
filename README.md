# 3Sigma Reports SFDX Project

This repo holds the code for the 3Sigma Reports managed package.

The latest version of the packaged contents is available in the `/bin/latest.zip` archive.

This is the first managed package I wrote; it needs a _lot_ of work (but was highly functional when in use).


TODO: Generate data and screenshots to showcase functionality.

# Setup

# Entity Relations

There are no custom objects for this right now.
